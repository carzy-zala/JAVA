                &&   and   operator (both are true than true other wise false)
                ||   or   operstor (either a true than true other wise false) 

        ----------------->If Else Operrator <------------------------
                it is same as c++
                all scope rule are same and all declartion is same

                                   }
                we can nest the if-else
                                  if(condition)

                                      }
                we can not use {} when one and only one statement to execute
        ---------------->Switch Case<----------------------------
                
                same as c++
                
                Declaration :
                              swittch(Condition)
                              {
                                  case <condition>:
                                                   break;
                                  default :
                              }


        Note :-

          ---> All above operator are not use in refrence type variables like string we have to use different methods of class to do comparision
          ---> break; statement stop further execution and go out of scope
